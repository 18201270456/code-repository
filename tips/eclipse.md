###### PyInstaller:

    install pywin32 for python2.7 first.
    
    then, put src files under PyInstaller Path, like "F:\work\python\src\pyinstaller-2.0\", run
    
    >pyinstaller.py -w test.py
    
    test\disc\ is where the result is.
    
    
    -w, --windowed, --noconsole
     	use a windowed subsystem executable, which on Windows does not open the console when the program is launched. On Mac OS X it allows running gui applications and also creates also .app bundle. This option is mandatory when freezing an gui application on Mac OS X. Otherwise the application will not start..
