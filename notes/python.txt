PyInstaller:

install pywin32 for python2.7 first.

then, put src files under PyInstaller Path, like "F:\work\python\src\pyinstaller-2.0\", run

>pyinstaller.py -w test.py

test\disc\ is where the result is.

-w, --windowed, --noconsole
    use a windowed subsystem executable, which on Windows does not open the console when the program is launched. On Mac OS X it allows running gui applications and also creates also .app bundle. This option is mandatory when freezing an gui application on Mac OS X. Otherwise the application will not start..
